  <h2><strong>Adoption Info</strong></h2>
  <span class="text">Virginia Beach Goldendoodles make amazing family pets and/or service dogs.  We are looking for forever loving homes for our babies.  We do not sell to pet stores. ​We get many requests to ship our puppies but, we will not ship them.  The thought of putting one of our babies in a crate and leaving them at the airport is very scary!!!​ Many of of our Goldendoodles stay local with the ocean and the bay so close but, word must be getting out about our amazing pups, as we have Goldendoodles as far as California, Minnesota, Connecticut, and New York!!​<br><br>
  Our pups have a spay/neuter contract.   We provide you with a 1 year health guarantee.   We require that our pups be returned to us if an owner or family can no longer care for their dog.  We NEVER want one of our babies to end up in a shelter or pound.  We will gladly re-home our Goldendoodle. ​This rarely happens...in fact, we have many people returning to get a second Virginia Beach Goldendoodle (or even a third :) )!!<br><br>
  We continuously take deposits on our upcoming litters.  Our non-refundable deposit is $200.  We ask that you indicate a sex/color preference if you have one.  We let you select your pup in the order that we have the deposits at about 4 weeks of age. They can later be picked up at 7-8 weeks old. We have been doing this since we starting breeding.   With such healthy happy pups, we have yet to have a pup that was not chosen!!  We do not have puppies all of the time but we will gladly share our planned litter schedule with you.  We pride ourselves in a small home based situation with lots of TLC.  Our Goldendoodles are definitely worth waiting for!​<br>
  We welcome your visits to meet our puppies and their parents.  We love educating people about our pups and love showing off our amazing Standard Poodles and Golden Retrievers !!  We want you to see the amazing temperaments of our dogs.  We have lots of great information to share with you.  After all, who knows more about dogs, temperaments, and training than someone who has been breeding Goldendoodles for 15+ years!<br><br>
  Our healthy happy pups come with a lifetime of support.  We encourage you to call or email  us with questions and concerns.  We send our pups home with pages of helpful puppy tips.  We want your housebreaking and crate training to be a smooth experience.  We also spend lots of time talking with our new owners about premium dog foods and nutrition.  Quality healthy food is so important.  We have recommended toys, training tips, grooming ideas and many other helpful tidbits to help you to become a great Virginia Beach Goldendoodle owner!!</span>
